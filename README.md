How to compile and run the program:
1) To run, have two terminal windows open in the respective directory that you download them in.
2) In the first terminal run python3 doSomething.py
3) In the second terminal run /triangle-app-v1.1


How we ensured we got the right solution:
We tested each transition for full functionality by comparing it to the exampler program on the course notes. For every input, there was a functional output (s). We-made full use of each event/action message that was provided and they all came in good use. The logic we used, built upon a previous course lab on implementing DFAs with python. That came in very good use to help build upon that to implement transducers in this project. In our testing, we have found no bugs. That means we believe that our product is a functional replica of the example provided. The only potential concern is that the error messages might not be implemented exactly how the instructions intend to specify.
